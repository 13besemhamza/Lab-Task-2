Whole page is developed in divs. 5 images are placed above, when clicked on an image, it enlarges below. So this work as a gallery plugin. You can directly open an image by clicking on it or you can also surf through images bvy clicking previous or next buttons.

Page is responsive, overall page. You can check by resizing the browser. Responsiveness is done by using widths in percentages.
Button tag is used for next previous buttons.

Thanks
